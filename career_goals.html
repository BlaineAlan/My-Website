            When it comes to what I particularly want to do with my degree I was always left at a blank, likely because of my lack of experience. However recently I have been super motivated to work on projects that involve a visual side to them. In that way, I believe front-end work is more my style, being able to actually see and interact with what I am making rather than the "image" of what I'm making be theoretical. <br><br>
            This sort of work can come in many different forms, however web-design (like making this website), has been really fun and I'm having to stop myself from adding a bunch of extra designs and features for the sake of time. I also am hoping to get into game-making and possibly make a clone of a simple game in order to get a peak into that kind of world, as that interests me greatly as well. This can mean just trying to code a simple 2D platformer, or it can mean trying to get into software like Unity and Unreal Engine. <br><br>
            Regardless, This sort of career path really peaks my interest and I'd love to delve deeper into it and gain as much experience as I can to hopefully secure a job down this path one day, as it seems very fulfilling to work on something that people actually see and interact with.
