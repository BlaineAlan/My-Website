                <div class="about_me_text">
                    I am an active member of Ohio University's Marching 110 as an Alto Saxophone player, and was chosen to be a member of the Uniform Staff for the '25 season. I've been doing marching band since 8th grade, so I was honored to be chosen to make the most exciting band in the land! This program requires an online audition before you're accepted into the band, and then an in person audition to decide your placement on the field. There are also regular mid-season auditions where someone could take your spot on the field. <br><br> 
                    We practice everyday during the football season, about 15 hours a week. Each instrument section holds sectionals outside of practice as well, to help learn and memorize the music for each show. <br><br>
                    This program is very rigorous and competitive, especially when balancing a full course workload as well, but I've made so many friends and memories from this band, and gotten to travel to places like London to perform, that I would've never experienced otherwise. We've even gotten to perform with TBDBITL in the OSU stadium!

                    I was in Cub Scouts in Elementary School and eventually moved onto Boy Scouts in Middle School and High School. I served every position you can in the troop throughout my time, including the Senior Patrol Leader, which is basically the leader of the troop who organizes events and weekly meetings. My senior year of High School before I turned 18 I completed my community service project that I had to plan and find funding for at a local park, completely repainting a shelter house, to get my Eagle Scout rank. I gained so many experiences and friends during my time, and it definitely contributed to my ability to lead and organize.

            <div class="aboutmeh"> Video Games
                <div class="about_me_text">
                    I've been playing video games my whole life, from the family Wii we'd play Wii Sports on, to playing on my PC that I built, to VR. I am fascinated by how they're made, and I have fiddled with making little games myself. Many people see games as just a fun thing to do and that's it. But video games have created a platform for storytelling and creativity that I believe is unmatched anywhere else. They're like movies with beautiful visuals, music, and story, except they're interactive and even more immersive than a movie. Some of my favorites are: <br><br>
                    <u>God of War</u> - The whole series but especially the two recent ones are just masterpieces of character growth
                    <br>
                    <u>Mario Galaxy 1 & 2</u> - The nostalgia from these games is unmatched, the music is phenomenal
                    <br>
                    <u>Rocket League</u> - Although I don't play it much anymore, I enjoyed my time grinding ranked in this game (GC 3), and I still play around in freeplay just because the physics are fun
                    <br>
                    <u>BOTW & TOTK</u> - These games are on a whole other level when it comes to open world, so much fun just exploring every nook and cranny and I wish I could experience them for the first time again
                    <br>
                    <u>Blade & Sorcery</u> - This is about as much fun as you can have in VR; the physics, the combat, the environments, the mods, all just a perfect experience
                    <br>
                    <u>Mario Odyssey</u> - This game has a special place in my heart as it's the first game I played when I got my switch. I also enjoy the speedrunning community in this game and have contributed a little myself (my PB is like an 1hr 20min though)

                <div class="about_me_text">
                    Before I had my own PC I would use the old family Mac computer for my games. It was incredibly slow and every game would have to be run at the lowest quality possible for the fps to be somewhat reasonable. My brother had gotten into PC building and one Christmas he bought me some basic parts for my own PC build! It started off with smaller, cheaper parts. But over the years I have continued to upgrade not just my PC but my entire setup to where it is today.
                    <br><br>
                    <u>OS</u> - I was running Windows on my PC all the way up until the summer of 2025. Windows was planning on ending Windows 10 security support, so my only option was to upgrade to Windows 11 (which would add about 60 more gbs of bloat) OR bite the bullet and switch to linux, and that's what I did. So I got rid of Windows entirely and switched to Fedora Linux. Some of the applications that I like aren't available on linux, which is just part of the journey. But I have so much free storage now that everything Windows is gone. I've been really enjoying it, and coding is much easier without having to use WSL!
                    <br><br>
                    <u>GPU</u> - Currently I use an AMD Radeon RX 6600. This GPU had a special sale when it first came out so I snatched it before scalpers could make it any more expensive. It runs great, looks great, and it even runs VR super well!
                    <br><br>
                    <u>CPU</u> - Currently I use an AMD Ryzen 7 5700X with an AIO cooler. Before this I was running the AMD Ryzen 5 2600 with the stock cooler, which is one of the most popular CPUs for its cost and reliability. But once I upgraded my GPU, my CPU was bottlenecking pretty hard, so it was time for an upgrade.
                    <br><br>
                    <u>RAM</u> - Currently I have 4 sticks of Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 8 GB DDR4 RAM. They're colorful and pretty, and 32 GBs of RAM is plenty for my needs.
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Other Accessories</u> - My case is a Corsair 4000D Airflow, My power supply is a EVGA 750W, I have various RGB fans from Amazon, and my Motherboard is a TUF B450-Plus. I also have a dual monitor setup with one 1440p 180Hz main monitor from acer, and one 1080p 100Hz secondary monitor from Spectre. I used to have an RGB keyboard and mouse that were gamer-ey and clacky, but I've since replaced them with simple bluetooth ergonmonic ones from logitech. I also use a standing desk I got from Facebook Marketplace for the ergonomics.
