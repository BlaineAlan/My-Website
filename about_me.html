        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            Hello! My name is Blaine Cochnsparger, I'm a sophomore computer science major at Ohio University in Athens. I graduated from Allen East High School in Harrod in 2023, and intend to graduate from here in May of 2027.

            I pretty much knew instantly that I wanted to come here for college, and a big part of that decision was from the marching band here at OU, the Marching 110! This band is super competitive to get into, so I was thrilled when I was accepted into the band after my audition on the Alto Saxophone. Since then I have had major success when it comes to getting spots on the field through more auditions, and next year I hope to interview for the Marching Section Leader position. Band has played a big part in the friends I've made and the things I've done, like getting to travel to Detroit, Orlando, and even London to perform!

            Aside from band, I enjoy tinkering with computers, art, and exercise. Especially since a lot of computer science means sitting at a desk for long periods of time, I try my best to stay agile and keep my body healthy!
