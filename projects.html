                    TrackIt is a mobile app I built using React Native and Expo over the Summer of 2025. The goal was to create an easy way to track workouts, so there's a simple calendar system where you click on the day, add the workout details, choose a color for the workout, and once you're done it'll appear as a colored dot on the calendar; that way you can color-code your workouts to easily see what you've done on the calendar. You can then click on a day to view what workout you did. <br> This is my biggest project yet and it required to learn a lot of javascript, memory, storage, and UI design, but it came out great, and there's still lots of features and updates planned to keep making improvements!

                    This was a group project game created during the Spring Semester of 2025. Our group of 4 was tasked to create a game that included the use of a Large Language Model (LLM). What we came up with was a simple Python platformer that utilized the LLM to generate dialogue between the player and NPCs. So the AI would be given a character description of who it was and what it knows, and then it could generate messages to the player, and generate 3 responses for the player to choose from, and it could do this forever. This platformer was a fun semester-long project, and the physics and gameplay made it memorable.

                    This was a solo project for my Databases class, done during November-December 2025. The idea was to utilize an IMDb database of movies, reviews, genres, etc. and create a simple GUI that the user could interact with to search for what type of movie they're looking for: genre, director, keywords in reviews. Then it would return to the user the movies that best fit those descriptions. This was accomplished using MySQL and the MySQL python connector, as well as HTML for a simple web app.
